# Seoul Building Explorer

Seoul Building Explorer shows when more than 700,000 buildings in Seoul were approved to use. The building data is from [NSDI](http://openapi.nsdi.go.kr/nsdi/eios/ServiceDetail.do?svcSe=F&svcId=F010). Seoul Building Explorer used [Tile Stache](http://tilestache.org/) to generate custom tiles, [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for hosting, [Tangram](https://mapzen.com/products/tangram/) (powered by [Mapzen.js](https://github.com/mapzen/mapzen.js) ) to render them.
